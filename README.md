## A funny story

It's not a funny story about me but about my cat. One day my girlfriend have took some chicken fillet out of the fridge. She puts the object on the kitchen table before going to the toilet. While she was there, my cat just jump on the table, took a whole chicken fillet, and come at my feet (I was on my computer) to give me the chicken fillet as a gift, with an air of joy.

### TL;DR

My cat just give me a food she just steal.
